      Bookings are performed in a 2 step process, as the prices we give you
      access to are agent prices, and hence one of our agents will need to make
      the booking for you. Simply select the hotel and dates you would like to
      stay, then provide one of our agents with your credit card details, and
      they will process the booking for you. It is that simple. If you do not
      have a specific hotel, you can also submit a general request, and then
      our agents will research the place you would like to travel to, find hotel
      options and give you some properties to choose from. This process takes
      more time, as our agents will have to do more research. So the quickest
      way is for you to select the place and dates, then have our agents simply
      book it for you.

      When you enter a search, our system will search all available hotel
      distributors and display the best online rate to you. When you make your
      booking most of the time, the prices will be even lower than what you see
      in the search result page.
