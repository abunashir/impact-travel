<h3><%= site_abbreviation %> Terms of Use</h3>
<p>Last updated: January 01, 2017</p>

<p>
<%= site_title %> ("<%= site_abbreviation %>" or "we") welcomes you (the "Customer" or "you") to its website (the “Site”). References to the Site are deemed to include derivatives thereof, including but not necessarily limited to mobile websites and applications. The Terms of Use –as defined below- apply to our services, directly or indirectly made available to you through whatever means, including online reservations, customer service requests or otherwise. By accessing, activating, browsing and using the Site and/or by making a reservation request through <%= site_abbreviation %>, you acknowledge and agree having read, understood and agreed to the Terms of Use. Our different policies and guidelines, which can be found throughout the Site, including but not limited to, the
<a href='/privacy'>Privacy Policy</a>, <a href='/reservation_guarantee'>Reservation Guarantee</a>, <a href='/cancellation'>Cancellation Policy</a>, <a href='/refund'>Refund Policy</a>, <a href='/faq'>FAQs</a>, etc. (collectively the "Policies"), should be read in conjunction with and are an integral part of these terms and conditions and are hereby included by reference. The terms and conditions set out below and the Policies are collectively referred to as the “Terms of Use”. If you do not agree to the Terms of Use, please cease use of the Site immediately. The Terms of Use – as may be amended from time to time – constitute the entire agreement, and supersede any other agreements or understandings (oral or written), between you and us with respect to their subject matters unless explicitly stated otherwise.</p>

<h4>1. Scope of our Service – Information on the Site</h4>
<p>Through the Site, <%= site_abbreviation  %>provides an online platform through which you can browse different types of travel services, including but not necessarily limited to hotels, hostels, serviced apartments, B&Bs, rooms for rent, cottages, cruises, tours, resorts, etc. (collectively, the "Service(s)") and request reservations for such Services. By submitting a booking request through the Site, you make an offer to book a reservation at the price listed for such reservation and such other terms and conditions stated on the Site, which shall become a binding contract when accepted by <%= site_abbreviation %>, which in turn means the reservation has been confirmed by the Accommodation. We will indicate the acceptance of your Accommodation booking via an e-mail confirmation (with a voucher for prepaid Accommodations). We reserve the right to reject bookings as set out below.</p>

<p>When rendering our services, the information that we disclose about Accommodations is based on the information provided to us by our suppliers or providers (including but not necessarily limited to the Accommodations, their representatives, distributors, destination management companies (DMCs), channel managers, partners, etc.). As such, the Accommodations or their representatives are given access to an extranet or other connectivity solution through which they are fully responsible for updating all rates, availability, description, pictures, booking conditions or accommodation policies and other information which is displayed on the Site. Although we will use commercially reasonable skill and care in performing our services we will not verify if, and cannot guarantee that, all information is accurate, complete, correct or up to date, nor can we be held responsible for any errors (including manifest and typographical errors), interruptions (whether due to any (temporary and/or partial) breakdown, repair, upgrade or maintenance of the Site or otherwise), inaccurate, misleading or untrue information or non-delivery of information. Each Accommodation remains responsible at all times for the accuracy, completeness and correctness of the Accommodation information displayed on the Site. Changes in market conditions or circumstances may occur on short notice which may make information displayed on the Site inaccurate or outdated. In case of problems, our Customer Service will use its commercially reasonable efforts to assist you and serve as a point of contact with the Service Provider. Please note that <%= site_abbreviation %> is one of many channels Accommodations use to make their inventory available for reservation. When a search result indicates that a particular Accommodation has no more rooms available, that means the room type is not available for reservation through <%= site_abbreviation %>.</p>

<p>The Site does not constitute and should not be regarded as a recommendation or endorsement of (the quality, service level or rating of) any Accommodation listed on the Site. We hereby expressly disclaim any representation, warranty or undertaking in relation to the quality, status or adequacy of any Accommodation listed on the Site. The Accommodations can be ranked on the Site according to different criteria (star rating, reviews, etc.). The default ranking is based on an automated algorithm, which may be updated or amended from time to time.</p>

<p>We reserve the right not to accept customers or bookings (or in exceptional cases to cancel confirmed ones) at our discretion and for whatever (legal) reason without the need to justify such refusal. Typical reasons for rejecting a customer or booking include, but are not limited to: Accommodation request, breach of the Terms of Use, force majeure events, trade or economic sanctions, embargoes, legal restrictions, (suspicions of) fraud or theft, suspected criminal activity, suspicious bookings, submission by customer of misleading or erroneous information, credit card problems, inappropriate behavior, threats, insults, violence, refusal to supply information, practical obstacles, communication problems, obvious errors (see below), history, blacklisting by governments or international organizations (USA, EU, UN, Singapore,…), etc. In case a booking is rejected or cancelled by <%= site_abbreviation %> and a payment has already been made, you will receive a refund of the total booking value. We also reserve the right to bar (“blacklist”) users from the Site, on a permanent or temporary basis, at our discretion. Any such blacklisted user must not attempt to use the Site under any other name or through any other user. See also below for our fraud prevention mechanisms.</p>

<p>In rare cases, we may also have to cancel or reject a booking due to "obvious errors", independent of the origin of such errors. For clarity, an obvious error is a mistake on the Site (e.g. in terms of price) which a reasonable person would not consider to be normal. The amount charged will be reimbursed without charge in such case. Whether to cancel or reject a booking for this reason is in <%= site_abbreviation %>’s sole discretion.</p>

<p>Please note that suspected group bookings can also be rejected or cancelled by <%= site_abbreviation %> or the Accommodation as most Accommodations have specific procedures for group bookings. Contact our customer service team for more information.</p>

<p>Circumstances such as ongoing renovations, Accommodation booking errors, and specific guest needs can affect the quality of your stay. Be sure to let the Accommodation know any special requests or requirements you have at check-in.</p>


<h4>A word about star ratings</h4>
<p>The Accommodation star ratings are provided for your information only. The star ratings are based on information we have received from our suppliers, including the Accommodations. We do not independently verify star ratings. A star rating is only indicative of the level of comfort you can expect to find in a particular Accommodation, with a higher star rating generally being indicative of a higher level of comfort and amenities. For more detailed information, please check the detailed description on the Site. Please be aware that star ratings can vary greatly on the basis of location, available alternatives, local market conditions, practices or other circumstances. Thus, it is possible that a star rating in one particular country or city is not comparable to the same star rating in another country or city due to such circumstances. Star ratings do not necessarily reflect all the amenities or services that might be available at an Accommodation, and some amenities and features may not be available in every room or at every property with a particular star rating. If there are particular amenities or features that are important to you, please contact our Customer Service and inquire as to the availability of such amenities or features.</p>

<p>By requesting a reservation on the Site, you represent and warrant that you are not covered by any international sanction program.</p>

<p>If and when applicable, you will satisfy all your obligations, tax, withholding or otherwise as required by your country of residence.</p>

<h4>3. Prices, Additional Charges and Prices</h4>
<h4>A. Prices</h4>
<p>We strive to have the most competitive prices and we want you to pay the lowest price possible for your stay at an Accommodation. Should you find your Accommodation room reservation, with the same booking conditions, at a lower rate on the Internet after you have made a booking through us, we will match the difference between our rate and the lower rate under the terms and conditions of the Best Price Guarantee. For a claim to be valid under this guarantee, it must satisfy and be submitted in compliance with all relevant terms and conditions of our <a href='/price_guarantee'>Best Price Guarantee</a>.</p>

<p>Sometimes cheaper rates are available on the Site for a specific stay at an Accommodation for the same room type, however, these rates made by Accommodations may carry special restrictions and conditions, for example in respect of cancellation and refund. Please check the room type and rate details thoroughly for any such conditions prior to making your reservation. The same room type may have different rates, depending on such restrictions and conditions (see also section 6 below).</p>

<h4>B. Additional Charges by Accommodations</h4>
<p>Please note that all prices on the Site are for your Accommodation room reservation only and are for the requested stay dates and for the number of people indicated, unless indicated otherwise. The Accommodation room reservations rates are displayed per room and per night. Except where indicated otherwise, <%= site_abbreviation %> will typically display the rate exclusive of tax recovery and service charges (see below for more details) on the Site, and display these additional tax recovery and service charges during the booking path. Without prejudice to what is set out below, you will see the total inclusive price prior to confirming your booking. Display settings may vary, but this will at the latest show on the final booking page (before the confirmation screen). Please verify every step of your reservation on the booking form; you can discontinue the booking at any time prior to the final confirmation screen (please see below for post-booking cancellations). What is included in the rate is displayed on the Site (under the Accommodation information section or prior to the final booking confirmation) and/or in the confirmation email/voucher. Breakfast is typically not included unless explicitly stated otherwise. Hotel resort and other mandatory fees (see below) and certain local city, tourist or occupancy taxes (when applicable) that are required to be collected directly from guests, are typically not included in the rate unless stated otherwise. Please verify the Accommodation description or policies on the Site. Insurance of any kind is never included in the rates. The standard Accommodation room reservations are for single or double occupancy, extra beds will usually incur extra charges. The Accommodation may also refuse to accept additional persons if not duly informed in advance. Please note that certain Accommodations may charge you a so-called additional but mandatory “resort fee” (or similar) for the use of certain of their services. This resort fee is typically not included in the price, but it will be mentioned in the Accommodation description on the Site. You may also be charged directly by the Accommodation for energy surcharges, baggage handling fees, newspaper delivery fees, in-room safe fees, tourism fees, or housekeeping fees. The practice to add additional Accommodation fees is outside <%= site_abbreviation %>’s control and occurs in certain markets, including the USA. Needless to say, optional incidental fees and personal consumptions are almost never included, for example, parking charges, minibar charges, phone calls, room service, food & beverage, gala dinners, movie rentals, internet, etc.. During certain high season periods, certain Accommodations will add on a compulsory gala dinner (e.g. for New Year, Christmas, Chinese New Year,...). This is not included in the room rate, but will be displayed on the booking form. Please check the "Accommodation Information", "Booking Conditions", "Cancellation Policy" or similar wording on the Site. When in doubt whether something is included, you can contact our Customer Service team.</p>

<p>For certain Accommodations, a compulsory transportation or transfer fee will be charged on top of the room rate at the request of the Accommodation, or at your option where available. This is especially common for island destinations (e.g. the Maldives) where you need Accommodation transportation to reach the Accommodation. Please note that <%= site_abbreviation %> does not organize any transportation, this is always organized by and offered by or on behalf of the Accommodation, who is responsible for such transportation services, not <%= site_abbreviation %>. <%= site_abbreviation %> does not assume any liability for the quality, safety, frequency or service levels of such transportation services. In some jurisdictions, the Accommodations are also required to directly collect a local bed or city tax from the guests. Governments have on occasion issued additional taxes and may ask the Accommodations to collect these directly. These charges, if applicable, will be payable by you to the Accommodation directly at checkout. Please verify with the Accommodation or Customer Service which extra fees are (not) included.</p>

<h4>C. Currency Conversion</h4>
<p>Rates can be converted into different currencies for your convenience. Accommodation rates provided in a currency other than the currency displayed on the Site are converted to the displayed currency at a rate determined by the Provider, which may include a conversion and/or processing fee for certain currencies. The currency and amount you see displayed at the latest on the final booking page is the maximum amount the Provider will charge to your credit card. In case of immediate payment, you will see the converted amount that will be charged to your card. In case of “Book Now, Pay Later”, you will see an estimate of the converted amount, which will only be charged at the exchange rate of the future payment date, meaning it could be different from the estimate. Your bank may impose additional fees on the transaction, over which <%= site_abbreviation %> has no control. Please note that exchange rates fluctuate daily. </p>

<h4>A Word on Charges for Taxes and Fees</h4>
<p>In connection with facilitating your Accommodation transaction, the charge to your credit card may include a charge for taxes and fees (“Taxes and Fees”) unless indicated otherwise. This charge includes an estimated amount to recover the amount we pay to the Accommodation in connection with your reservation for taxes owed by the Accommodation including, without limitation, sales and use tax, occupancy tax, room tax, excise tax, value added tax and/or other similar taxes. In certain locations, the tax amount may also include government imposed service fees or other fees not paid directly to the taxing authorities but required by law to be collected by the Accommodation. The amount paid to the Accommodation in connection with your reservation for taxes may vary from the amount we estimate and include in the charge to you. The balance of the charge for Taxes and Fees, if any, is a fee we retain as part of the compensation for our services and to cover the costs of your reservation, including, for example, customer service costs. If the balance is negative, we will absorb such difference. The charge for Taxes and Fees varies based on a number of factors including, without limitation, the amount we pay the Accommodation and the location of the Accommodation where you will be staying, and may include profit that we retain.</p>

<p>Except as described below, we are not the vendor collecting and remitting taxes to the applicable taxing authorities. Our Accommodation suppliers, as vendors, include all applicable taxes in the amount billed to us and we pay over such amounts directly to the vendors. We are not a co-vendor associated with the vendor with whom we book or reserve our customer's travel arrangements. Taxability and the appropriate tax rate and the type of applicable taxes vary greatly by location.</p>

<p>For transactions involving Accommodations located within certain jurisdictions, the charge to your credit card for Taxes and Fees includes a payment of tax that we are required to collect and remit to the jurisdiction for tax owed on amounts we retain as compensation for our services.</p>

<p>For Accommodations where you need to pay at the Accommodation, the price may or may not include taxes and services. Please verify the booking conditions and your confirmation mail or voucher or contact our Customer Service team.</p>

<p>As stated above, certain cities or municipalities charge city, bed, tourist occupancy or equivalent taxes that have to be collected by the Accommodation locally.</p>

<h4>4. Privacy</h4>
<p>We respect your privacy. Please have a look at our <a href='/privacy'>Privacy Policy</a> for further information.</p>

<h4>5. Credit card – Payment – "Book Now, Pay Later" – Age - Fraud</h4>
<p>For pre-paid Accommodation bookings with <%= site_abbreviation %>, your credit card will be charged by the Alliance Partner for the full price (sometimes without any option for refund depending on the Accommodation’s booking conditions, see below) upon reservation and confirmation of the booking or, in case of a "Book Now Pay Later" booking, at the future point in time communicated in the confirmation email. When using "Book Now, Pay Later", please ensure that the credit card is valid and has sufficient credit on the future payment date. If the credit card cannot be charged on such date for whatever reason, the booking will be cancelled unless you can ensure that the card payment can be authorized on time. Please check the reservation details thoroughly for any such conditions prior to making your reservation. <%= site_abbreviation %> and its’ Alliance Partners will process refunds, if and when applicable, within a reasonable timeframe. For certain Accommodations, we will not charge your credit card, as you will pay the Accommodation directly for your stay (post-paid). However, in such cases some Accommodations may pre-authorize your card, charge a deposit or charge the full price of the reservation up-front. Accommodations may require credit card details in order to guarantee your reservation. As such, we will send your credit card information directly to the Accommodation at which your booking is made and we may verify (i.e. pre-authorize) your credit card as well. In order to safeguard and encrypt your credit card information when in transit to us, we use the "Secure Socket Layer (SSL)" technology for our services.</p>

<p>In the event of credit card fraud or unauthorized use of your credit card by third parties, you should contact your bank or card issuer immediately upon becoming aware of such unauthorized use. If you suspect an unauthorized or fraudulent booking was made via <%= site_abbreviation %>, please contact our Customer Service team immediately.</p>

<p>In order to make a booking you must be over 18 years old (or the age of majority in those countries and territories where it is higher than 18) and have the full legal capacity to make the transaction (or have the authorization from your legal guardian). You undertake that the credit or debit card you are using is your own or that you are authorized to complete the booking with this card and that there are sufficient funds to cover the cost of the transaction. You accept financial responsibility for all transactions made under your name or account.</p>

<p>You undertake that the details you provide us with in making a booking are fully correct. <%= site_abbreviation %> reserves the right not to accept certain credit cards. <%= site_abbreviation %> may add or remove other payment methods at its discretion.</p>

<p>We have stringent fraud detection and prevention mechanisms in place. In certain cases, we may require additional information or verifications to validate and confirm the booking, as explained in more detail on the Site. A small verification charge or pre-authorization may also be made to your card when using "Book Now Pay Later". The balance will be charged after confirmation or, in case of "Book Now Pay Later", on the future payment date (see the comment above about the possibility of cancellation in case the card cannot be charged on that date for whatever reason). Reservations are not confirmed until you have received a confirmation mail with a voucher and it is possible that an Accommodation could become fully booked during the fraud check, in which case the reservation will no longer be available. <%= site_abbreviation %> can never be held liable in such cases. Additional information submitted will be treated in line with strict industry standards to protect privacy, using encryption for transmission and specialized agents for verification. If you choose not to submit the additional information or if we are not satisfied with the information received, the booking will not be completed and fully cancelled and any amounts charged (including the verification charge where applicable) will be refunded.</p>

<h4>6. Booking conditions - Cancellations, No-Shows, Early Departure and Late Check-Out – Specific Accommodation Policies - Special Needs</h4>
<p>By making a reservation on our Site, you accept and agree to the relevant Accommodation booking conditions, including cancellation and no-show policies applicable to that booking, and to any additional (delivery) terms and conditions of the Accommodation that may apply to your reservation or during your stay, including for services rendered and/or products offered by the Accommodation (the delivery terms and conditions of an Accommodation can be obtained with the relevant Accommodation). The general cancellation and no-show policy of each Accommodation is made available on the Site at the Accommodation information pages or under “Booking Conditions”, “Cancellation Policies” or the like, and in the confirmation email and voucher. Please note that you may be charged for your cancellation in accordance with the Accommodation’s cancellation and no-show policy, in some cases for the entire stay or the first night. We recommend that you read the cancellation and no-show policy of the Accommodation carefully prior to making your reservation. If you fail to check in to your Accommodation on time on the day of your reservation and do not alert the Accommodation, the remaining portion of your reservation may be canceled and you may not be entitled to a refund, depending on the terms and conditions of the applicable Accommodation. Regardless of the Accommodation’s cancellation policy, <%= site_abbreviation %> reserves the right to charge a cancellation fee, this will be indicated on the Site. Please carefully check the Accommodation details thoroughly for any such conditions prior to making your reservation. Some Accommodations will charge extra for early or late check-outs.</p>

<p>If you wish to review, adjust or cancel your reservation, please revert to the confirmation email and follow the instructions therein or contact Customer Service.</p>
<p>Many Accommodations have specific policies around children, accompanying travelers and/or traveling with pets. As indicated above, you are strongly advised to check with Customer Service, the Accommodation itself or to verify the Accommodation policies.</p>

<p>Special Needs: If you have special needs (e.g., wheelchair accessible room) you must contact Customer Service or the Accommodation and verify that special needs can be met. Please note that all special requests are subject to availability and cannot be guaranteed by <%= site_abbreviation %>. Depending on the policy of the applicable Accommodation, your reservation will be refunded, canceled or modified if special needs cannot be met. If available, your request will be confirmed upon arrival.</p>

<h4>7. Travel advisory – Visa requirements</h4>
<p>Although most travel is completed without incident, travel to certain destinations may involve greater risk than others. We urge passengers to review travel prohibitions, warnings, announcements and advisories issued by their governments prior to booking travel, particularly when travelling to international destinations.</p>

<p>By displaying Accommodations in particular destinations, <%= site_abbreviation %> does not represent or warrant that travel to such points is advisable or risk-free and <%= site_abbreviation %> can never be held liable for damages or losses that may result from travel to such destinations. <%= site_abbreviation %> can under no circumstances be held liable for any incidents occurring during your stay at the Accommodation. You are strongly advised to check the relevant travel advisories issued by your government for any country you are visiting and to take the necessary precautions. You are also advised to take personal travel insurance.</p>

<p><%= site_abbreviation %> cannot be held liable for any loss incurred in the event of your failure to hold the necessary passports, visas and documentation for your journey. You are advised to check with the relevant embassies, consulates and/or visa departments of the countries you wish to visit. It is your responsibility to obtain whatever travel documents are required.</p>

<p>Please note that some countries have strict rules and regulations on the import of restricted or prohibited goods, items or substances. These can include but are not necessarily limited to alcohol, tobacco, perfumes, drugs, medication, books, movies, DVDs, adult entertainment materials, food stuffs, plants, animal parts, etc. It is your responsibility to verify and comply with applicable regulations. Non-compliance can lead to severe penalties.</p>

<h4>8. Complaints</h4>
<p>If you have complaints about <%= site_abbreviation %>’s service, you can contact our Customer Service team. We will do our very best to help you. Please note that any complaints about the Accommodation (policies, standards, service, facilities, decoration, food, etc.) is ultimately a matter for the Accommodation itself. <%= site_abbreviation %> will coordinate directly with the Accommodation to try and find a mutually agreeable solution but cannot guarantee a satisfactory outcome.</p>
